# Fetch Cycle  

### Block Diagram  
*![Screenshot 2024-11-30 062808](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733bef95-19fb-44a5-b680-a83a6185272e)*  

### Theory  
The Fetch Cycle is the first stage of the RISC-V processor pipeline. Its primary function is to retrieve the next instruction from memory and update the program counter (PC). The fetched instruction is passed to the subsequent stages for decoding and execution.  

The key components of the Fetch Cycle are:  

1. **MUX**:  
**![MUX](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9ef6c3f-b106-419a-8480-6ce13dd56275)**  

The MUX selects between the next sequential program counter (`PCPlus1F`) and the branch target address (`PCTargetE`) based on the control signal `PCSrcE`.  
- **Inputs:**  
  - `PCTargetE` and `PCSrcE`: These signals are generated in the Execution Cycle.  
  - `PCPlus1F`: This is generated in the Fetch Cycle itself.  
- **Output:**  
  - `PC_F_next`: The next program counter value.  

2. **PC (Program Counter)**:  
*![PC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0411bda6-c393-4487-90a1-98fd7f8eb827)*  

The Program Counter holds the address of the current instruction and updates to the next instruction address during every clock cycle.  
- **Inputs:**  
  - `PC_F_next`: Provided by the MUX.  
- **Output:**  
  - `PC_F`: The current program counter value used to fetch the instruction.  

3. **IM (Instruction Memory)**:  
*![IM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0908b9d-6cdd-4715-a4bc-0a0bb55b5f17)*  

This module stores the instruction set of the processor. Based on the current `PC_F`, it outputs the instruction (`InstrF`) to be executed.  
- **Inputs:**  
  - `PC_F`: Current program counter value.  
- **Output:**  
  - `InstrF`: The instruction fetched for execution.  

4. **PC_ADDER**:  
*![PC_ADDER](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edd22453-3e34-44f1-9761-c5e14a4874bc)*  

This unit computes the next sequential program counter address by adding `1` to the current value of the `PC`.  
- **Inputs:**  
  - `PC_F`: Current program counter value.  
- **Output:**  
  - `PCPlus1F`: The next sequential program counter value.  

#### **1. Fetch Cycle:**
- Registers: `PC`, `Instruction_F`, `BranchTarget_F`
- Output to Decode: `Instruction_F`

# Decoder Cycle  

### Theory  
The Decoder Cycle is the second stage of the RISC-V processor pipeline. Its primary function is to decode the fetched instruction (`InstrD`) and generate control signals for the subsequent stages, including register reads and ALU control. The decoded instruction is used to determine the operation and data required for execution.

The key components of the Decoder Cycle are:

1. **Instruction Register (IR)**:    

The Instruction Register holds the fetched instruction passed from the Fetch Cycle. This instruction is then split into its constituent fields for decoding.
- **Inputs:**  
  - `InstrF`: The fetched instruction passed from the Fetch Cycle.
- **Outputs:**  
  - `InstrD`: The instruction in decoded form, ready for processing.

2. **Control Unit (CU)**:  
*![Screenshot 2024-11-29 132427](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ea58382-8fd2-41bf-abc9-01a8a40d4710)*  

The Control Unit decodes the instruction fields (`InstrD`) and generates control signals that guide the operations in the Execution and Memory cycles.

Here's the description of the **Control Unit (CU)** block in the format you requested:

- **Inputs:**  
  - `op`: 7-bit opcode of the instruction (`InstrD[6:0]`).
  - `fun7`: 7-bit function field (`InstrD[31:25]`).
  - `fun3`: 3-bit function field (`InstrD[14:12]`).

- **Outputs:**  
  - `alu_control`: 6-bit ALU control signal that determines the operation (addition, subtraction, etc.).
  - `regwrite`: Control signal to enable or disable writing to a register.
  - `ALUsrc`: 2-bit signal to select the second operand for the ALU (either a register value or an immediate value).
  - `memwrite`: Control signal to enable or disable writing to memory.
  - `resultsrc`: Signal to select the result source (ALU result or memory data).
  - `branch`: Control signal to indicate whether a branch operation is to be executed.
  - `jump`: Control signal to indicate whether a jump operation is to be executed.
  - `immsrc`: 3-bit signal to select the immediate value source for the operation.
  - `AUIPC`: Signal indicating if the instruction is AUIPC (Add Upper Immediate to PC).
  - `sh_D`: Control signal indicating if the instruction is a `SH` (store halfword).
  - `sb_D`: Control signal indicating if the instruction is a `SB` (store byte).
  - `lh_D`: Control signal indicating if the instruction is a `LH` (load halfword).
  - `lb_D`: Control signal indicating if the instruction is a `LB` (load byte).

3. **Register File**:  
*![Screenshot 2024-11-29 132309](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4afdf15c-6cbd-4d6e-b031-40d3bce9efef)*  

The Register File holds the general-purpose registers. The Register File is accessed to read values for the source registers (`rs1`, `rs2`) based on the instruction type.
- **Inputs:**  
  - `rs1`: Source register 1 (from instruction `InstrD[19:15]`).
  - `rs2`: Source register 2 (from instruction `InstrD[24:20]`).
  - `RegWrite`: Control signal from the Control Unit indicating whether to write data to the register file.
  - `WriteData`: Data to be written to the register file.
- **Outputs:**  
  - `Data1`: The value from the register file for source register `rs1`.
  - `Data2`: The value from the register file for source register `rs2`.

4. **Immediate Generator**:  
*![Screenshot 2024-11-29 132401](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e2cf90f-7df1-47a4-b43d-5ada5956c6b0)*  

The Immediate Generator extracts and sign-extends the immediate value from the instruction fields for use in operations that require an immediate value. The immediate value is decoded differently for each instruction type:

- **I-type (Immediate-type)**:  
  - Immediate is extracted from `InstrD[31:20]`.
  - The value is sign-extended to 32 bits.
  
- **S-type (Store-type)**:  
  - Immediate is formed by concatenating `InstrD[31:25]` and `InstrD[11:7]`.
  - The value is sign-extended to 32 bits.
  
- **B-type (Branch-type)**:  
  - Immediate is formed by concatenating `InstrD[31]`, `InstrD[7]`, `InstrD[30:25]`, and `InstrD[11:8]` (using bitwise operations to construct the immediate value).
  - The value is sign-extended to 32 bits.
  
- **U-type (Upper immediate-type)**:  
  - Immediate is extracted from `InstrD[31:12]`, and it is shifted left by 12 bits (to make space for the lower 12 bits set to 0).
  - The value is zero-extended to 32 bits.

- **J-type (Jump-type)**:  
  - Immediate is formed by concatenating `InstrD[31]`, `InstrD[19:12]`, `InstrD[20]`, `InstrD[30:21]` (using bitwise operations).
  - The value is sign-extended to 32 bits.

- **R-type (Register-type)**:  
  - No immediate value is used in R-type instructions, so the Immediate Generator outputs a zero value for these types.

- **LUI-type (Load Upper Immediate)**:  
  - Immediate is extracted from `InstrD[31:12]`, and it is shifted left by 12 bits (to set the upper 20 bits) with the lower 12 bits set to 0.
  - The value is zero-extended to 32 bits.

- **AUIPC-type (Add Upper Immediate to PC)**:  
  - Similar to LUI, the immediate is extracted from `InstrD[31:12]` and shifted left by 12 bits.
  - The value is zero-extended to 32 bits.

- **Load-type (I-type)**:  
  - Immediate is extracted from `InstrD[31:20]`, similar to other I-type instructions.
  - The value is sign-extended to 32 bits.

#### **2. Decode Cycle:**
- Registers: `regwrite_D_r`, `memwrite_D_r`, `resultsrc_D_r`, `RD_D_r`, `WriteData_D_r`, `ALUOp_D_r`, `rs1_D_r`, `rs2_D_r`, `imm_D_r`
- Output to Execute: `regwrite_E`, `memwrite_E`, `resultsrc_E`, `RD_E`, `WriteData_E`, `ALUOp_E`, `rs1_E`, `rs2_E`, `imm_E`

# Memory Cycle
*![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/027e9a87-2d42-4671-a603-50e016c5c67a)*

The `M_C` module is used to pass control signals and data between the Memory and Writeback stages of a pipelined processor. It interacts with the `DM` module for memory operations. Here's an overview:

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`, `reset`: Control signals for the clock and reset.
  - `MemWrite_M`: Memory write signal.
  - `RegWrite_M`, `ResultSrc_M`: Control signals for register write and result source.
  - `sh_M`, `sb_M`, `lh_M`, `lb_M`: Specific memory operation flags (e.g., shift and load operations).
  - `RD_M`: Destination register address from the Memory stage.
  - `ALUResult_M`, `WriteData_M`: ALU result and write data passed to the memory.

- **Outputs**:
  - `RegWrite_W`, `ResultSrc_W`: Forwarded control signals for the Writeback stage.
  - `RD_W`: Destination register address forwarded to the Writeback stage.
  - `ALUResult_W`, `ReadData_M`: Forwarded ALU result and read data for the Writeback stage.

- **Internal Registers**:
  - The `RegWrite_M_r`, `ResultSrc_M_r`, `RD_M_r`, `ALUResult_M_r` registers store the values for control signals and ALU results to be passed to the next stage.

- **Functionality**:
  - It stores and forwards control and data signals between stages in the processor pipeline.
  - The `DM` module is instantiated here for memory operations.

### `DM` Module (Data Memory)
*![DM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b8500cc-f137-4c27-89ff-57eb79bee78c)* 
The `DM` module is a simple memory block that simulates a data memory for your processor. It handles both memory reads and writes, with support for byte, half-word, and word operations.

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`, `reset`: Control signals for clock and reset.
  - `MemWrite_M`: Memory write signal.
  - `sh_M`, `sb_M`, `lh_M`, `lb_M`: Flags for specific memory operations.
  - `ALUResult_M`, `WriteData_M`: Address and data for memory operations.

- **Outputs**:
  - `ReadData_M`: The data read from memory.

- **Internal Memory**:
  - A 64-entry memory array (`dm`) holds 32-bit data. It is initialized to zero on reset.

- **Functionality**:
  - On reset, all memory entries are cleared.
  - When `MemWrite_M` is active, data is written to memory:
    - If `sh_M` is set, it stores a 16-bit word.
    - If `sb_M` is set, it stores an 8-bit byte.
    - If neither is set, it stores a 32-bit word.
  - When `MemWrite_M` is inactive, data is read from memory:
    - If `lh_M` is set, it loads a half-word.
    - If `lb_M` is set, it loads a byte.
    - Otherwise, it reads the full 32-bit data.

# Write Back Cycle
*![MUX](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcecd4c3-7a5d-4336-a7ce-dac8216ea8a1)* 
The `W_B_C` module is part of the **Writeback** cycle in a pipelined processor. It is responsible for selecting the appropriate result (either from the ALU or memory) and forwarding it to the register file for updating the destination register. This operation is critical for completing the execution of instructions that involve writing results back to registers.

#### **Inputs**:
- **ResultSrc_W**: Control signal indicating whether the result to be written back comes from the ALU or the memory.
- **ALUResult_W**: The result from the ALU, which can be written back to the register file.
- **ReadData_W**: The data read from memory, which can be written back to the register file.

#### **Outputs**:
- **ResultW**: The final result (either ALU result or memory data) that is written back to the register file.

#### **Functionality**:
- The `W_B_C` module uses a multiplexer (implemented in the `MUX1` module) to select between the ALU result and the memory data based on the value of `ResultSrc_W`.
- If `ResultSrc_W` is `1`, the result comes from the memory (i.e., `ReadData_W`).
- If `ResultSrc_W` is `0`, the result comes from the ALU (i.e., `ALUResult_W`).
- The selected result (`ResultW`) is forwarded to the register file to be written back into the destination register.

### `MUX1` Module (Multiplexer)
*![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0feea1ff-31f2-433a-8680-7e7494a519f0)*
The `MUX1` module is a simple **2-to-1 multiplexer** that selects between two 32-bit inputs based on the `ResultSrc_W` control signal. It is used to choose the result to be written back to the register file in the **Writeback** cycle.

#### **Inputs**:
- **ResultSrc_W**: Control signal that determines which input to select.
- **ALUResult_W**: The result from the ALU.
- **ReadData_W**: The data read from memory.

#### **Outputs**:
- **ResultW**: The selected result, either from the ALU (`ALUResult_W`) or from memory (`ReadData_W`).

#### **Functionality**:
- If **ResultSrc_W** is `1`, the multiplexer outputs the value of **ReadData_W** (memory result).
- If **ResultSrc_W** is `0`, the multiplexer outputs the value of **ALUResult_W** (ALU result).
- This allows the **Writeback** cycle to select the correct data to be written back to the register file.
